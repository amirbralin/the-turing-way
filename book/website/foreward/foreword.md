# Foreword

_The Turing Way_ is open for anyone to use, contribute to and share. 
You can inspect our resources on [GitHub](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way), contribute to the project as described in our [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) and re-use all materials ([see the License](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/blob/main/LICENSE.md)).

Although _The Turing Way_ core team is located in London (UK) and receives support from [The Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/), the project is designed to be a global collaboration.
Chapters have been written, reviewed and curated by members from international research institutes and universities, government departments, and industry.

The foreword section of _The Turing Way_ handbook currently provides the following information:
- {ref}`Background and history<fw-history>`

We are committed to creating a space where people with diverse expertise and lived experiences can share their knowledge with others, and help us use data science to improve the world.
